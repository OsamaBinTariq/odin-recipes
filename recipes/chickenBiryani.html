        <li>2 large onions (thinly sliced)</li>

        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves (chopped)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh mint leaves (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>4 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>6-8 black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon saffron strands (soaked in warm milk)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Water (for cooking rice and chicken)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large pan. Add cumin seeds, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnishing.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste to the pan and sauté for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in the chicken pieces and cook until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and biryani masala. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the oil separates from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in yogurt, chopped coriander, and mint leaves. Mix well and cook on low heat until the chicken is tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, boil water with salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li>Layer the cooked chicken mixture at the bottom of a large pot. Spread half of the partially cooked rice over it.</li>
        <li>Drizzle saffron milk over the rice and layer the reserved fried onions on top.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers with the remaining chicken mixture and rice. Drizzle more saffron milk and ghee over the final layer.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook on low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse and the rice to fully cook.</li>
        <li>Once done, fluff the biryani gently with a fork to mix the layers slightly.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh coriander and mint leaves, alongside raita or salad.</li>
    </ol>
