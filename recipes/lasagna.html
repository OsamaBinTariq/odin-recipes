    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a favorite comfort food around the world. It is a layered pasta dish traditionally made with sheets of lasagna noodles, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. The combination of hearty flavors and satisfying textures makes lasagna a versatile meal, perfect for family dinners, celebrations, or even casual gatherings. Each bite is a delicious blend of savory, cheesy goodness balanced with the sweetness of tomatoes and the aromatic kick of Italian herbs like oregano and basil.

        Over time, lasagna has evolved to include a variety of interpretations and dietary preferences. Some versions use vegetables like spinach or zucchini in place of noodles for a lighter option, while others swap the meat for plant-based alternatives to make it vegetarian. Whether traditional or modern, lasagna remains a dish that warms the soul and brings people together over its comforting and flavorful layers.</p>
