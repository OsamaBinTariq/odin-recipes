# Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. The goal is to build a simple recipe website to demonstrate foundational HTML and Git skills.

## Project Overview
- Create a basic website using HTML.
- Link multiple pages together.
- Use Git for version control, practicing cloning, committing, and pushing changes.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML.
- Working with hyperlinks to navigate between pages.
- Using Git commands to track and manage changes in a project.

This project serves as an introduction to web development and prepares me for more advanced concepts in The Odin Project curriculum.
